As a dad to be, I’m more or less a trained expert on this now.

> Aren’t you SO EXCITED?!?!

Sure, we’re excited. We’re also nervous and stressed and paranoid and freaking tired of people asking if we’re excited.

> (To the mom) Oh, you’re feeling [insert some horrible pregnancy related condition here]? Well just try [insert stupid home remedy or food here]! It works wonders!

No it doesn’t. Go away.

> Oh, you’re going to name it [insert name here]? Well, what about [insert completely different name here]? I like that a lot better.

Hey, great! Let’s drop the name we love and decided on in favor of a random name from a stranger!

> [Person starts rubbing the mom’s belly]

Good idea! Here, let me pick your nose.

> [Upon seeing a random kid misbehaving] You better get used to that now! You’ve got one on the way!

WTF! I do?! And you’re telling me kids are bad sometimes? I want out!

> Were you trying or was it an accident?

Don’t know what to say about this one. It’s just really really awkward to be asked that.

> Are you going to have another one?

We were kind of hoping to have this one first, and then decide. Is that ok?
