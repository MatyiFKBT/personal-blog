I love tools. It's a bit of an obsession. As an outlet for this, I'm starting a weekly screencast where I do short (like, 1-2 minute) intros into various tools that people might find useful.

It's called [Tool Time](https://twitter.com/watchtooltime) (yes, like in Home Improvement...please don't sue me).
